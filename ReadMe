PAPTO is a a novel algorithm to detect transient spectral events in extracranial neurophysiological recordings (MEG & EEG) where the spectral event properties are disambiguated from the backgorund aperiodic activity. PAPTO is an integration of the fooof algorithm from Donoghue et al., 2020 (https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/) with the spectral events detection algorithm from Shin et al., 2017 (https://github.com/hs13/BetaEvents).

Dependencies:
numpy: 1.16.4
pandas: 0.24.2
scipy: 1.2.0
fooof: 1.0.0
