PAPTO is a a novel algorithm to detect transient spectral events in extracranial neurophysiological recordings (MEG & EEG)
where the spectral event properties are disambiguated from the backgorund aperiodic activity. PAPTO is an integration of the
fooof algorithm from Donoghue et al., 2020 (https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/) with the spectral events detection algorithm 
from Shin et al., 2017 (https://github.com/hs13/BetaEvents).
